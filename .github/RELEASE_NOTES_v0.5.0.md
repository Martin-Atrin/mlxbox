## MLXBox v0.5.0

MLXBox is intentionally minimal: a thin, low-footprint macOS wrapper around MLX and MLX-LM.

### Highlights
- Unified `Models` surface: MLX community model availability + fit status + capability tags.
- Conservative fit logic to avoid recommending models that exceed available system memory.
- Downloaded-model chat flow with local `mlx_lm.server` startup and OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` routing.
- LoRA adapter support at inference time via `--adapter-path`.
- MLX-LM post-training support with dataset scaffolds and adapter metadata tracking.

### Runtime + packaging
- Best-effort runtime bootstrap for `llmfit`, `whisper-cpp`, `mlx`, `mlx-lm[train]`.
- Packaged release artifact generated by `scripts/package_release.sh`.
- Artifact: `dist/MLXBox-macOS.zip`.

### Positioning
This project is built to be as lightweight as possible on RAM and host resources, while keeping local model workflows one-click where feasible.
